## üí° Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Start with Sample Data
Don't try to load your own data first. Use the sample data generator to verify everything works.

### Tip 2: Use Small Warehouse
Start with SMALL or XSMALL warehouse. You can always scale up.

### Tip 3: Enable Auto-Suspend
Set warehouse auto-suspend to 5 minutes to save costs during testing.

### Tip 4: Check External Access
Maps won't work without external access integration. Follow the mapbox setup script.

### Tip 5: Bookmark Key Files
Keep these files handy:
- QUICK_START.md (for setup)
- DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md (for troubleshooting)
- INDEX.md (for navigation)

## üéØ Success Checklist

After setup, you should be able to:

- [ ] See the home dashboard with metrics
- [ ] View cell towers on an interactive map
- [ ] See heatmaps in geospatial analysis
- [ ] View predictions in AI analytics
- [ ] Access the performance dashboard
- [ ] Filter and interact with data
