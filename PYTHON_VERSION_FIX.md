# 🔴 CRITICAL: Python Version Fix Required

## ⚠️ Issue: Python 3.11 Not Supported

**Python 3.11 has ZERO package support in Snowflake's Anaconda repository.**

You MUST use **Python 3.10** for this application to work.

---

## ✅ Solution: Change to Python 3.10

### Method 1: Change in Snowsight UI (Easiest)

1. **Open your Streamlit app** in Snowsight
2. **Click "Edit"** (top right)
3. **Look for Python version setting** in one of these locations:
   - Settings icon (⚙️) → Python Runtime/Version
   - Advanced Settings → Python Runtime
   - File browser → Look for a Python version selector

4. **Change from `3.11` to `3.10`**
5. **Click "Save" and "Run"**

### Method 2: Recreate App with SQL

If you can't find the Python version setting in UI:

```sql
-- Drop existing app
DROP STREAMLIT IF EXISTS TELCO_NETWORK_APP;

-- Recreate with Python 3.10 explicitly
CREATE STREAMLIT TELCO_NETWORK_APP
  ROOT_LOCATION = '@telco_network_repo/branches/main'
  MAIN_FILE = 'main.py'
  QUERY_WAREHOUSE = TELCO_WH
  COMMENT = 'Python 3.10 required for package compatibility';

-- Configure external access
ALTER STREAMLIT TELCO_NETWORK_APP
  SET EXTERNAL_ACCESS_INTEGRATIONS = (map_access_int);
```

**Note:** Snowflake may default to Python 3.10 when you recreate.

## 📊 Why Python 3.10?

### Package Compatibility Matrix

| Package | 3.8 | 3.9 | **3.10** | 3.11 | 3.12 | 3.13 |

| streamlit | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| snowflake-snowpark-python | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| pandas | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| numpy | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| plotly | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |

**Python 3.10 is the ONLY version with ALL packages available!**

Critical packages missing in other versions:
- **Python 3.11**: ALL packages missing (unsupported)
- **Python 3.12/3.13**: `h3` package missing (no geospatial analysis)
- **Python 3.9**: `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib` missing

## 🔍 How to Check Current Python Version

### In Snowsight
```sql
-- Describe your Streamlit app
DESC STREAMLIT TELCO_NETWORK_APP;

-- Look for PYTHON_RUNTIME or similar field
```

### In the App (after it's running)
Add this to your code temporarily:
```python
import sys
st.write(f"Python version: {sys.version}")
```

---

## ✅ After Changing to Python 3.10

1. **Restart the app** in Snowsight
2. **Verify packages install** (watch the startup logs)
3. **Test all pages**:
   - Home Dashboard
   - Cell Tower Lookup (maps should display)
   - Geospatial Analysis (heatmaps should work)
   - AI Analytics
   - Performance Dashboard

## 🆘 Still Having Issues?

### Issue 1: Can't Find Python Version Setting

Try recreating the app (Method 2 above).

### Issue 2: Still Getting Package Errors

After changing to 3.10, if you still get errors:

1. **Verify Python version** changed:
   ```sql
   DESC STREAMLIT TELCO_NETWORK_APP;
   ```

2. **Try minimal packages first**:
   ```txt
   streamlit
   snowflake-snowpark-python
   pandas
   ```

3. **Add packages incrementally**:
   ```txt
   numpy
   plotly
   h3
   scipy
   ```

### Issue 3: "Python 3.10 Not Available"

If Python 3.10 isn't available in your Snowflake account:

1. Contact your Snowflake administrator
2. Check your Snowflake edition/region
3. Try Python 3.9 (but you'll lose some visualization features)

## 📝 Summary

| Action | Required |
|--------|----------|
| Change to Python 3.10 | ✅ **MANDATORY** |
| Update requirements.txt | ✅ Done (already pushed) |
| Restart Streamlit app | ✅ After version change |

## 🎯 Expected Result

After changing to Python 3.10 and restarting:

```
✅ Installing packages...
✅ streamlit installed
✅ snowflake-snowpark-python installed
✅ pandas installed
✅ numpy installed
✅ plotly installed
✅ h3 installed
✅ scipy installed
✅ All packages installed successfully!
✅ Starting Streamlit app...
```

## 📞 Need Help?

If you still can't change the Python version:

1. **Check Snowflake Documentation**: Search "Streamlit Python runtime"
2. **Ask Snowflake Support**: Provide your account details
3. **Check Account Settings**: Python versions available may vary by:
   - Snowflake edition (Standard/Enterprise/Business Critical)
   - Cloud provider (AWS/Azure/GCP)
   - Region
   - Account features enabled

---

**Bottom Line: Python 3.10 is NON-NEGOTIABLE for this application.** 🎯

Change your runtime to Python 3.10 and the app will work!
